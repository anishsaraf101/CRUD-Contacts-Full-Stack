# CRUD-Contacts-Full-Stack

This full stack app is able to create, read, delete, and update contacts. It has a basic user interface that allows the user to manage the contact list. The application uses Flask to build an API to send and recieve JSON information to the front-end JavaScript. This is my first introduction to full stack software development!
