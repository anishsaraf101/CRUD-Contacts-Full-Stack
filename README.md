# CRUD-Contacts-Full-Stack

This is a full-stack web application designed to manage contacts through basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app allows users to efficiently manage a contact list with a simple, intuitive interface.

### Features
	•	Create: Add new contacts to your list with essential information.
	•	Read: View the list of existing contacts.
	•	Update: Edit contact details as needed.
	•	Delete: Remove contacts from the list.


### Technologies Used
	•	Backend: Flask (Python) - A lightweight framework to build the RESTful API
	•	Frontend: JavaScript (Vanilla) - For handling the user interface and API requests
	•	Database: (Add if using a database like SQLite, MySQL, etc.)
	•	API: JSON - Data is exchanged between the frontend and backend in JSON format


Note: This is my first full-stack project, and I’ve learned a lot about backend API development, frontend interaction, and full-stack integration.
